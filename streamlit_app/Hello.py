    This app was built to help me track my resume performance. I have my resume uploaded so I can track 
    automatically how my resume is doing compared to job descriptions that are produced everyday on Indeed.com.\n
    It also helps me to do a sort of A/B testing of different versions of my resume.
    You can also upload your resume and compare it with job descriptions for different data professions.\n
    This app is built based on a micro-service architecture with mainly the following technologies: streamlit, fastapi, airflow, mongodb, docker and docker-compose. The code is available on [github]().
    you can download the code and run it locally on your machine. you can also easily modify the code to fit your needs if you are looking 
    for a job in a different field.\n
    Please keep in my mind that the system was recently put on production and it is still in development so there is not a large amount of data in the database for now. 
    A data collection pipeline is running every day to collect job descriptions from Indeed.com and store them in the database. In order to further enrich the database 
    I will be running a data collection task for older job descriptions.
